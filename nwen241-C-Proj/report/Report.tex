\maketitle
In this assignment I have learned to pass by reference across methods and the wonderful use of pipes. I really enjoyed learning about pipes, and, if my understanding is correct, pipes are similar to sockets, but for networks, so I hope in future years to learn more about pipes and sockets to make programs more scalable and modular.
\section{Code implementation}
All three parts of the assignment are complete and follow the prototypes provided. I truly hope the code is meeting all the requirements, because I have now re-written it twice: a first version was implemented with the prototypes and logic as I though would make sense for such program, and a second version was then re-written to meet the handout requirements after talking to Ian.
\section{Valgrind}
To test for any memory leek I have used Valgrind to check is the memory allocation was freed before terminating the program. Here is an output showing the commands and the terminal output:
