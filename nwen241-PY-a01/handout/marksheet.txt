ASSIGNMENT 1: NWEN241 : 2015

Student ID:300338937
Student Name:Trazzi, Diego
========================================
CORRECTNESS:
Pythagoras: passed 5/5 cases, x 3 = 15.
Distance: passed 1/1 cases, x 15 = 15.
Print Before: passed 8/8 cases, x 2 = 16.
Grading: passed 15/15 cases, x 1 = 15.
CORRECTNESS MARK = 61
========================================
CODE STYLE:
Name conventions: 4/5.
Commenting: 5/5.
Semi colons: 5/5.
CODE STYLE MARK = 14/15
========================================
COMMENTS:
Good:
Comments are used sparingly but to good effect. Your implementation of the print_before function is very good and succinct.


Bad:
A few pointers:
 - ** is the exponent operator in python. Alternatively, you *could* use math.pow() (BE CAREFUL - read the docs).
 - So close to perfect with your implementation of python naming conventions! mkrIdx, line 130, is camelCase - camelCase is only used in python for naming classes (google PEP8). One thing you'll learn with python is just because you can do something and it works, it doesn't mean you should :p

========================================
MARKING NOTES:
CORRECTNESS: The marking for correctness is based upon
running the automated tests.

We will double-check cases where there are a large number of 
failures just in case there is a file encoding problem or similar 
but other problems will result in lost marks.

There are different numbers of tests for each function so we have 
applied a weighting to the tests.

CODE STYLE: The marking for the code style is based upon the 
conventions we asked you to use when completing this assignment:

Naming conventions Follow these formats: function_name,
function_parameter_name and local_var_name.

- Use comments to document anything non-obvious.

- Don't put commands on same line separated by semicolons.

Generally a mark of 0 means you didn't follow the convention
anywhere in the assignment, mark of 1 means you did it at least
once, mark of 2 means you did it at least once in more than
one function, mark of 3 means that you did it at least once in
all functions, mark of 4 means that there was only one place
where you didn't do it and mark of 5 meant no errors anywhere

COMMENTS: You should receive some short comments highlighting
something good and something bad about your solution. This might be
stylistic or advice on problems to correct for next time. Where you
have lost marks for say style we will tell you why.

FINAL MARKS: We will calculate a final weighted mark that reflects
a 90:10 ratio between marks for correctness and marks for style.
